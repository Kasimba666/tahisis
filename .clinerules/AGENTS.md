Use Vue 3 with Options API, SCSS, Element Plus, and Yarn. Code must be consistent: camelCase for JS, kebab-case for CSS and components, component filenames with capital letters. Write async calls only with .then().catch. Project structure includes assets, components, composables, layout, pages, store, services, styles, and router. Components are ordered as template, script (name, props, data, computed, methods, watch), and scoped style, with imports always above export default. Styles are split into variables.scss for variables, themes.scss for light/dark themes using CSS variables switched via data-theme on html/body, and main.scss as the entry point and global rules. All CSS colors must be in hsl. Use Element Plus components by default, applying the current color scheme and rules, overriding native styles in main.scss. The interface must be very compact with minimal paddings.
